function reponse = question20Performance()
    reponse = [ 4 2 3 1 ];
    % [EVAL] correct answer is 2 4 3 1 
%     The way we solved this was by running several instances and getting the
%     average time. The charge said that we should just manually run it a couple of times
%     one at a time for it to stabilize due to the way Matlab compiles functions.
