- we'll be mostly working in calculerProbabilitesParPixel.m and grabcut.m
- with grabcut, it's an iterative algo. it will check each pixel if there's a probability its in the foreground/background, based on pixel intensity and approximation of other pixels around it.
- It'll take the intensity of the pixels of the background has a higher chance will be on the background or foreground. It does large crunch calculations.
- the code needs to convert the image to color (he says you can just copy paste ex 9 to it)
- when doing the loop, it'll be in grabcub.m
- the mask in calculerProbabilitesParPixel(image, masque); of grabcut.m
- E = computeEnergy(neighborhoodWeights, double(L==1), objProbabilitees, bkgProbabilitees); 
	- used to find if the image has changed or not
	- E is the quantity of movement/variation intensities in the image
	- with this, we can find if the probabilities of the background has changed from the last iteration
	- this is number 5
- Number 6
	- we want user inputs (background, foreground)
	- the user will have to draw on the image itself (can use a rectangle or pencil or tagging or whatever)
- 6e, for objProbabilitees, bkgProbabilitees
	- the weights can be hardcoded like 999999
- 7 is dice index to check if segmentation is properly done
- verify your answers using GT folder (ground truth)
